# LaTeX Templates

This repo holds various LaTeX templates that were either created by me or that I find useful and want to keep an example of.
I will try to keep them as minimal as possible, compilable with LaTeX (pdflatex), without sacrificing functionality.

## Contents:

### CV template

Intended to be a modern CV for technical / industrial applications, rarely longer than a single page.
It can be modified for any other industry, apart from IT and software engineering.
I believe it to be a good starting point for further customization.

### Homework / report template

Template for a lab/homework assignments or reports.
